### The Challenge

Our client operates one of the premier auctioneer websites for large construction machinery globally. Despite enjoying a surge in business, they faced a significant hurdle in scaling their operations. Their existing system was rife with challenges, including minimal automation and excessive complexity. Many critical processes still relied on manual intervention, such as printing and emailing documents to customers. This inefficiency resulted in increased costs, prolonged lead times, software glitches, and hindered their growth potential.

### The Solution

I served as the technical frontend anchor for the Checkout Experience team. Our team built the frontend user flow from scratch that brought the user from the point of winning an item in an auction, to payment, to invoice. Our app was built using the server side React framework, Next.js. We also built a backend-for-frontend responsable for fetching and transforming the data from third party apis.
